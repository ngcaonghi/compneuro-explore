# Computational Neuroscience Playground
**Personal projects with neural datasets.**

This repository hosts my personal exploratory projects using publicly open neural datasets, with the intent to gain more familiarity with toolkits necessary for computational neuroscience.

*Update on August 21, 2020: I'm working on the datasets produced and provided by Steinmetz* et al *as described in this paper: [Distributed coding of choice, action and engagement across the mouse brain.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1787-x) Some code snippets are provided by Nick Steinmetz and the organizing team at Neuromatch Academy, and are annotated whenever used in the notebook.*
